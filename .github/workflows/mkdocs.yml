# This workflow takes the content of the Documentation~/ directory, and uses MkDocs to generate a static website from MarkDown files (*.md).
# Once built, the website is then deployed to GitHub Pages.
# Make sure you have selected "GitHub Actions" mode in Settings > Pages.
# After running this workflow, the website should be accessible at https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]
